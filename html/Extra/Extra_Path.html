                        <h3>A turn on the road</h3>
                        <p>
                            Having exhibited great potential for both the Humanities and quantitative sciences from a young age, I applied to undergraduate studies in engineering and ranked fifth among thousands of candidates in a comprehensive selection process. I was admitted to the University of São Paulo, often considered the top university in Latin America, and remained among the best students in my cohort.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my undergraduate studies, I was involved both in academic tutoring and in scientific initiation, which culminated in the publication of an article. I was highly commended by my supervisor, who supports me to this day and wrote one of my letters of recommendation. Due to my excellent performance, I was also selected for a dual degree program at ENSTA ParisTech, France. However, as I studied in this new country, I developed an autoimmune disease that impaired my performance for the next few years and caused me to take longer than expected to graduate.                        
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This ailment compelled me to delay the start of my career until I could find treatment. As I looked for alternatives, I developed skills in Python, Data and Information Sciences, and Statistics. I also went through a period of introspection, which marked a shift in my career and led me to the current path.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While I had always envisioned a career that would impact society for the better, my vision of engineering and production as a means for better living was incongruous with the increasing levels of depression, divorce, stress, and lack of purpose throughout most of the world. Studies such as the Harvard Study of Adult Development led me to the conclusion that building cooperation, community, and meaningful daily routines would be essential in the decades to come.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With renewed purpose, I discovered in 2022 a treatment combining medicine and a restrictive diet, which allowed me to resume my career. I then passed another competitive selection process to work in a prestigious public job in the Paulínia City Hall. My function combined data management, which allowed me to use many of the skills I had developed during my career hiatus, and human resources management, starting me on my path toward realizing my goals. I gained knowledge of concepts such as personality, psychometrics, workplace ethics, and team dynamics. After one year, I decided to build a career in management and was admitted to the BYU MBA program.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With this new opportunity, I became acquainted with academia and research on various topics. I served as a Teaching Assistant for three different courses and embraced an opportunity to work on a project as a Research Assistant, on which I am still currently engaged. It consists of assisting Dr. Isaac Smith, Associate Professor of Organizational Behavior and Human Resources, in finding academic publications on various topics to support a multifaceted project he’s engaged in. This has been a valuable opportunity to become acquainted with current research on topics associated with Organizational Behavior.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am now applying for a Ph.D. program, and I hope to take this next step in 2025.
