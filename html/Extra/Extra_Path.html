                        <h3>A turn on the road</h3>
                        <p>
                            Having exhibited strong potential in both the Humanities and quantitative sciences from a young age, I applied to undergraduate studies in engineering and ranked fifth among thousands of candidates in a comprehensive selection process. I was admitted to the University of São Paulo, widely regarded as the top university in Latin America, and consistently ranked among the top students in my cohort—eventually being selected for a dual degree program at ENSTA ParisTech in France.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the program neared completion, I came to realize that, more than engineering solutions alone, data-informed decision-making was one of the most critical challenges future leaders would need to address. I was particularly well positioned for this path, having consistently excelled in programming, statistics, and analytical thinking. I began developing skills in Python, data science, and SQL—seeking tools that could help bridge the gap between complex systems and human-centered outcomes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This new direction led me to succeed in another competitive selection process for a prestigious public position at the Paulínia City Hall, where I worked in both data management and human resources. The role enabled me to apply my technical skills in a practical context and confirmed my decision to pursue a career in data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After one year, I sought to further develop my managerial and analytical capabilities and was admitted to the BYU MBA program. This opportunity deepened my understanding of business across all functional areas—an essential foundation for anyone seeking to generate data-driven insights that truly support a company’s strategy and market positioning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, I am building a career in data analysis. Drawing from my background in engineering, public service, and business, I aim to work at the intersection of people, process, and data—translating complexity into clarity and using insights to improve both organizational outcomes and employee experiences.
